# Health-AI-Labs

This is repository of medical AI experimental notebooks exploring various applications of machine learning in healthcare, from early diagnosis and imaging to classification and segmentation. Projects include deep learning models for brain tumor detection, malaria diagnosis, chest X-ray classification, and more.
These notebooks represent exploratory work toward building scalable, locally relevant AI solutions for global health challenges.

> **Note:** 
Several notebooks are exploratory and may contain incomplete code cells or placeholder results. This repo is meant to reflect experimentation, not final models. Refinements are in progress

## Goal
To explore diverse applications of machine learning in healthcare and build a working portfolio of experiments. These notebooks reflect ongoing skill development and curiosity in applying AI to real-world medical challenges.
